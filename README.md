# Basics

- Not every frontend (UI) requires HTML pages like mobile apps(React Native, Android, iOS), these UI are build totally decoupled from the server, they don't need any HTML code
- Other examples that doesn't need HTML pages are Single Page Web Apps(React etc), Service APIs(eg: Google Maps APIs)
- Doesn't need HTML code, just need backend that needs to serve the data : this is code idea for building Rest APIs because here we need different kind of responses (not HTML views)

- REST: Representational state transfer; i.e transfer data instead of User Interfaces
- Only the response & request data changes, NOT the general server side logic

- We can exhcange data in many formats
